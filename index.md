I am a postdoctoral fellow in Epidemiology within the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Maryland, College Park. I graudated with my Ph.D. in Environmental Health Science from the Department of Global, Environmental, and Occupational Health at the University of Maryland in 2025. My areas of specialization were environmental epidemiology and the food-energy-water nexus. My research interests are focused broadly around climate change and chemical exposures (e.g., from plasticizers). My dissertation research was focused on quantifying the effects of heat exposure on risk of hospitalization and mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) that receive in-center hemodialysis treatment. For this work, I use case-crossover methodology to estimate the associations between heat exposure and the two health endpoints. I have also been involved in research assessing the effects of wildfire smoke exposure in patients with ESKD.
