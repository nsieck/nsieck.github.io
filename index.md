I am a Ph.D. candidate in Environmental Health Science in the Department of Global, Environmental, and Occupational Health at the University of Maryland, College Park. My areas of specialization are environmental epidemiology and the food-energy-water nexus. My research interests are focused broadly around climate change and chemical exposures (e.g., from plastics). My dissertation research is focused on quantifying the effects of heat exposure on risk of hospitalization and mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) that receive in-center hemodialysis treatment. For this work, I use case-crossover methodology to estimate the associations between heat exposure and the two health endpoints. I have also been involved in research assessing the effects of wildfire smoke exposure in patients with ESKD.
