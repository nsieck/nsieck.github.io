Hi! I’m Nicole. As you probably already know from the homepage and sidebar, I am a Ph.D. candidate in Environmental Health Science in the Department of Global, Environment, and Occupational Health in the School of Public Health at the University of Maryland.

I took a *circuitous* path to get to environmental health. For my undergraduate studies, I attended Arizona State University (ASU) where I majored in Speech and Hearing Science and minored in Communication. I was also enrolled in Barrett, The Honors College, which involved taking some extra classes, classes for honors credit, and completing an undergraduate thesis. My honors thesis was titled, “Sentence Recognition with a Pulse Train Vocoder.” This project was supervised by William Yost and involved having participants listen and repeat sentences that were passed through a vocoder to simulate cochlear implant listening. I graduated summa cum laude and with honors in 2013.

Immediately after finishing my undergraduate degree, I headed to Austin, TX to start the Doctor of Audiology (Au.D.) program at The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin). At UT Austin, I took classes, worked in a number of clinical settings, and became involved in several student organizations. I served as the Vice President of the UT Student Academy of Audiology chapter as well as the Secretary for the UT student chapter of the Acoustical Society of America. I continued to be interested in research, and completed a T35 NIH Research Traineeship during the summer of 2015 at Boys Town National Research Hospital where I worked with Stephen Neely and Michael Gorga on an project measuring distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. 

Back at UT Austin, I completed a capstone project during my third year. This was a small project that looked at chirp-evoked auditory brainstem responses. Like virtually all Au.D. students, I then went on to start my clinical externship after my third year. 

My externship was completed at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) under the guidance of Judy Dubno and Lois Matthews. At MUSC, I primarily worked in the Hearing Research Program where I collected clinical data on participants for a large, longitudinal study of presbycusis. I graduated a semester early, but remained at MUSC as a research audiologist to finish my externship year. While at MUSC, I began researching hearing science public health Ph.D. programs, but was uncertain as to what direction I wanted to pursue for a Ph.D. 

So, how did I come to environmental health from audiology? Beginning in high school, I had a burgeoning interest in industrial agriculture and the impact of fast food on health and the environment after reading a book and watching some documentaries on the topic. During undergrad, I slowly started to learn more about the food system and climate change, and began taking steps to reduce plastic consumption. After moving to Austin, I continued to learn about environmental health issues in my free time, though I didn’t necessarily label it as such. Around this time, I started learning about endocrine disrupting chemicals and made some more small changes to my behavior to account for what I was learning about. Then, this interest further increased when I had kids and I realized that environmental health was what I was truly passionate about. This motivated me to pivot directions and pursue a Ph.D. in environmental health.
