## Current Projects

### End-stage kidney disease and climate change 
Currently, I am focused on the risk of adverse health outcomes following climate-related exposures in patients with end-stage kidney disease. This work is part of a collaboration between Amir Sapkota's lab at UMD and the Renal Research Institute, which is a wholly owned research subsidary of Fresenius Medical Care North America. 
This is the project that my dissertation is a part of.

## Previous Projects

### Scoping review of interventions to reduce exposure to bisphenols and phthalates

During my PhD, I worked on a large scoping review of interventions to reduce exposure to bisphenols and phthalates. We included all types of interventions, which we divided in the groups: Dietary, Clinical, Policy, and Other. This was a large undertaking - the searches yielded >10,000 references to screen. I used CADIMA software to facilitite the review process. 
The main finding from this review is that the different types of interventions were successful, overall. However, policy interventions were the most effective in the long-term. In conclusion, more policies are needed to reduce exposure to these chemicals, all known endocrine disruptors, in order to protect public health. 


### Global STEWARDS

I was a fellow of the 2021 Global STEWARDS cohort.
